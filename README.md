# comboloader

This is a simplification and refactor of 
[djamboloader](https://github.com/jlauron/djamboloader) to the point 
where keeping the upstream reference alive is almost meaningless. However,
my thanks go out to @jlauron to publishing the initial code under
a BSD-style license.

The app is now a 12factorized stand-alone Django shell meant to be
deployed standalone.

More docs soon.
